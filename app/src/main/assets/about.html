        <h1 class="main_title">Test app for Rozetka company</h1>
        <h2 class="main_title">App developed by Alex Karpov </h2>
        <p> This application is used as HILT dependency injection.</p>
        <p>My choice was stopped on this framework, because despite the fact 
            that it is still in the Alpha version, it still works stably, is 
            convenient, and it is also developed by Google and in my opinion it
             will best fit the Android floor and so will support for a long time and
              efficiently.</p>
              <p class="center">Why didn't I use a clean Dagger 2?</p>

              <p>Quite simply, Hilt is an add-on for Dagger 2 and already at this stage all the basic functionality of Dagger 2 is perfectly supported by Hilt.</p>

              <p>In this application, I added several additions, such as the history of saving images, as well as share.</p>
